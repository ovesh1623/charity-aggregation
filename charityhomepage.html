          <h1 class="one">Why do we need Charity?</h1>
          <p >Charity is the act of extending love and kindness to others unconditionally, which is a conscious act but the decision is made by the heart, , without expecting a reward. When Charity is carried out selflessly, it is a one-way act where a person gives but asks for nothing in return.</p>
          <p>Charity is essential and therefore meant to be done for public benefit, relief and to provide assistance to people at times of need in any part of the world, especially who are the victims of war, natural disaster, catastrophe, hunger, disease, poverty, orphans by supplying them with food, shelter, medical aid and other fundamental needs.</p>
          <p>The greatest gift to our community would be when we contribute to making lives better; when we touch lives by the dint of donations or charity, spreading light to the most needy and enlighten our souls in the process.</p>
